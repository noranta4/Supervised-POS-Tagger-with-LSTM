# Supervised-POS-Tagger-with-LSTM
Supervised POS Tagger with LSTM. 

Second homework of the Natural Language Processing course, prof. Roberto Navigli.

University project â€¢ 2016 - Natural Language Processing - MSc in Computer Science, I year

The statement of the problem is in `Homework2.pdf`, the solution code is is accompanied by a report of the performed experiments (`report.pdf`), I strongly suggest you read it to understand the solution code.

## Introduction
A Part-Of-Speech Tagger (POS Tagger) is a piece of software that reads text in some language and assigns parts of speech to each word (and other token), such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. 

Given a sentence we want to find the correct part-of-speech (POS) tag for each word. This is a classification
problem with sequential data. The objective of the homework is to address this problem on the English data
of the Universal Dependencies TreeBank with a Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network
(LSTM), that is a very effective classifier for this type of problem.

## Results
The results are satisfactory, more than 90% of words
are correctly classified.

See the report for a detailed discussion of the results and to see scores and graphs.
